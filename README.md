## 2.0 is out!!!!
https://monkey3three.ddns.net is the 2.0 website. Feedback is appreciated!

## Netlify Version [DEPRECATED]

Got rid of this because Netlify was going to charge me as it was about to hit the bandwith limit, yet I was on the free tier. I was meaning to delete this one for a while because of this reason but since its almost 
100% bandwith used for this month, I've finally done it. Netlify files are still up on github, feel free to host it for yourself.

## GitHub Version [DEPRECATED]
This versio is also shut down, for many reasons. Limitations, long build times, the fact it's a static website so they'res not much I can do with it. This github version is again free to host yourself, just replace index.md with the contents of index-legacy, Since the current index.md redirects you to the new website. Same for games-legacy.txt
