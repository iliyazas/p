Create an issue containing what blocker they are using. Don't have time now but eventually I will get around to this.


## Netlify Version [DEPRECATED]

Got rid of this because Netlify was going to charge me as it was about to hit the bandwith limit, yet I was on the free tier. I was meaning to delete this one for a while because of this reason but since its almost 
100% bandwith used for this month, I've finally done it.

## New Version
Making a new version of monkey3three using Apache, will be up soon. Since it's not a static website it's a lot more things I can do. If you have any suggestions, just post something in the discussions tab of the github.
Update: ported over pretty much everything, got a ssl certificate (took me 2 months) and i am ready to start adding features! (4th may 2024)
