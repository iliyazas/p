## What if this is blocked for you?

Create an issue containing what blocker they are using. Don't have time now but eventually I will get around to this.

## Updates?
I will release a '1.0' patch for the github version, no features or anything added just cleaning things up. I will probably update monkey3three indefintely, or for a long time at least. But I am moving on from the github version, 2.0 website releasing soon. Really soon in fact, I'm almost done. Though I may have leaked the website beta accidentally... If you look hard enough you'll see it.

## Netlify Version [DEPRECATED]

Got rid of this because Netlify was going to charge me as it was about to hit the bandwith limit, yet I was on the free tier. I was meaning to delete this one for a while because of this reason but since its almost 
100% bandwith used for this month, I've finally done it. Netlify files are still up on github, feel free to host it for yourself.

## New Version AKA 2.0
Making a new version of monkey3three using Apache, will be up soon. Since it's not a static website it's a lot more things I can do. If you have any suggestions, just post something in the discussions tab of the github.
Update: ported over pretty much everything, got a ssl certificate (took me 2 months) and i am ready to start adding features! (4th may 2024)
update2: 2.0 releasing pretty soon.
update 3: almost done!
