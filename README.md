## What if this is blocked for you?

Create an issue containing what blocker they are using. Don't have time now but eventually I will get around to this.

## 2.0 is out!!!!
https://monkey3three.ddns.net is the 2.0 website. Feedback is appreciated!

## Netlify Version [DEPRECATED]

Got rid of this because Netlify was going to charge me as it was about to hit the bandwith limit, yet I was on the free tier. I was meaning to delete this one for a while because of this reason but since its almost 
100% bandwith used for this month, I've finally done it. Netlify files are still up on github, feel free to host it for yourself.

## Future of this version?
This will remain up, but will not receive any updates unless something breaks.
